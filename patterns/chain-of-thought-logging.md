name: Chain of Thought Logging
description: Send high-level "Thinking" messages during multi-step orchestration to improve observability and perceived responsiveness.
challenge: Multi-tool or multi-agent flows can leave users waiting in silence with no visibility into what the agent is doing.

## Pattern

This pattern creates a lightweight logging topic that turns orchestration progress into italicized `_Thinking: ..._` chat messages. It is useful for multi-step tool chains, MCP calls, child-agent orchestration, and reasoning-heavy models where users would otherwise experience 10 to 30 seconds of silence.

### How it works

The topic declares an `AutomaticTaskInput` variable with `shouldPromptUser: false`. The orchestrator reads the variable's `description` field to understand what data to fill in — for example, a high-level summary of the step it just completed — and populates the variable automatically. The topic then sends that value as an italicized `_Thinking: ..._` chat message.

This works across both reasoning and non-reasoning models. The orchestrator narrates its own actions (which tool it called, which agent it routed to, what it found) regardless of the underlying model's architecture. For reasoning models, the orchestrator provides a safe high-level summary rather than exposing raw internal chain-of-thought.

> **Tested with:** GPT-4.1, GPT-5 Chat, GPT-5 Auto, GPT-5 Reasoning, Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus.

### Example user experience

```
User: "What's the latest status on Project Alpha?"
Agent: _Thinking: Looking up Project Alpha in the project tracker..._
Agent: _Thinking: Found 3 recent updates. Checking team assignments..._
Agent: _Thinking: Cross-referencing with the deadline calendar..._
Agent: Here's the latest on Project Alpha: <final answer>
```

### Instruction to add

Add the following to the agent instructions. In the Copilot Studio UI editor, type `/` to auto-complete the topic name. If editing YAML directly, use the exact topic name as written:

```
After every tool, topic, or step you take (except when you are already
calling /Log Chain of Thoughts or other debug/logging topics), log your
intermediate reasoning by calling /Log Chain of Thoughts.
```

The recursion guard is best-effort because it relies on natural-language instructions, not a hard platform stop.

## When to Use

- Your agent uses multiple tools, MCP servers, or child agents that chain together.
- Users experience long waits during multi-step reasoning with no feedback.
- You need a debug or observability aid to see what the orchestrator is doing step by step.
- The agent uses reasoning models where extended thinking creates long silent pauses.

## YAML Example

**Log Chain of Thoughts topic** (create a topic named `Log Chain of Thoughts` and paste into the Code editor view):

```yaml
kind: AdaptiveDialog

inputs:
  - kind: AutomaticTaskInput
    propertyName: CoT
    description: High-level step summary for what you just did and why (no system prompts, secrets, PII, or raw chain-of-thought)
    shouldPromptUser: false

modelDescription: log chain of thoughts

beginDialog:
  kind: OnRecognizedIntent
  id: main
  intent: {}
  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_9XILFq
      activity: "_Thinking: {Topic.CoT}_"

inputType:
  properties:
    CoT:
      displayName: CoT
      description: High-level step summary for what you just did and why (no system prompts, secrets, PII, or raw chain-of-thought)
      type: String

outputType: {}
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not use this for pure knowledge-search agents; a simple knowledge hold message is usually a better fit.
- Each log is an extra orchestrator call, so this increases Copilot credit consumption.
- Multiple `_Thinking: ..._` messages can make the conversation busier; validate the UX with stakeholders.
- Keep the `AutomaticTaskInput.description` strict so the orchestrator does not leak secrets, PII, system prompts, or raw chain-of-thought.
- If you notice loops, tighten the recursion guard wording or add additional defensive conditions around when the topic is called.
